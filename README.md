## Overview (https://archive.ph/HWgfX)

Archive webpage with archive.today
Adds a button to the Chrome toolbar. When clicked, it sends the URL of the current tab to archive.today to preserve a snapshot of the page, and opens the result in a new tab.
Also includes Link context menu to Archive or Search, Page context menu to Search. 
Archive URL can be bookmarked for future reference, shared, whatever. Uses HTTPS for security.
For similar functionality on Android, check out Share2Archive in the Play Store.

### NOTES
1. "Read your browsing history" permission is eliminated if not granted, or if you remove and reinstall the extension.
2. If you get an error, try again or try later. It's NOT an extension issue—archive.today sometimes gets overwhelmed.
3. CloudFlare DNS may not resolve archive.today, so if you experience DNS errors, try a different DNS server.
